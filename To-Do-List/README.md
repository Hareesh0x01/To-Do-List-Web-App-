# Funky To-Do List Application

A visually dynamic, animated to-do list web application with PWA support, alarm notifications, and dark mode. Features crazy animated backgrounds, custom sounds, and vibration alerts!

## üö® Important: Running the App Correctly

To avoid CORS, CSP, and audio loading issues, this app **must be run on a local web server** instead of opening the HTML file directly. Here are some options:

### Option 1: Using Python (easiest)
```bash
# Navigate to the app directory
cd path/to/To-Do-List

# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
Then open your browser and go to: http://localhost:8000

### Option 2: Using Node.js
```bash
# Install serve globally (if not already installed)
npm install -g serve

# Navigate to the app directory
cd path/to/To-Do-List

# Run the server
serve
```
Then open your browser and go to the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:3000)

### Option 3: Using VS Code Live Server
If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can install the "Live Server" extension and right-click on `index.html` to open with Live Server.
