To complete the PWA setup, add the following icon files to this folder:

1. icon-192x192.png - 192x192 pixel app icon
2. icon-512x512.png - 512x512 pixel app icon

You can create these icons using any image editing software with a funky, colorful design that matches the app's style.

For optimal appearance:
- Use a transparent background
- Ensure the design is recognizable at small sizes
- Use vibrant colors from the app's color scheme
- Make sure the design has enough padding around the edges

These icons will be used when installing the app on devices and for browser shortcuts.
